  lore: [
    'As a child, Yasuo often believed what the others in his village said of him: on the best days, his very existence was an error in judgement; on the worst, he was a mistake that could never be undone.',
    'Like most pain, there was some truth to it.His mother was a widow already raising a young son, when the man who would be Yasuo’s father blew into her life like an autumn wind.And, just like that lonely season, he was gone again before the blanket of Ionian winter settled over the small family.',
    'Even though Yasuo’s older half - brother, Yone, was everything Yasuo was not—respectful, cautious, conscientious—the two were inseparable.When other children teased Yasuo, Yone was there to defend him.But what Yasuo lacked in patience, he made up for in determination.When Yone began his apprenticeship at the village’s renowned sword school, a young Yasuo followed, waiting outside in monsoon rain, until the teachers relented and opened the gates.',
    'Much to the annoyance of his new peers, Yasuo showed natural talent, and became the only student in several generations to catch the attention of Elder Souma, last master of the legendary wind technique.The old man saw Yasuo’s potential, but like trying to bridle a whirlwind, this pupil was known to ignore most teaching.Yone pleaded with his brother to set aside his arrogance, gifting him a maple seed, the school’s highest lesson in humility.The next morning, Yasuo accepted the position as Souma’s apprentice, and personal bodyguard.',
    'When word of the Noxian invasion reached the school, some were inspired by the great stand that had been taken at the Placidium of Navori, and soon the village was bled of the able bodied.Yasuo longed to add his sword to the cause, but even as his classmates and brother left to fight, he was ordered to remain and protect the elders.',
    'The invasion became a war. Finally, one rain - slicked night, the drums of a Noxian march could be heard in the next valley over.Yasuo abandoned his post, foolishly believing he could turn the tide.',
    'But he found no battle—only a raw grave for hundreds of Noxian and Ionian corpses.Something terrible and unnatural had happened here, something that no single blade could have stopped.The land itself seemed tainted by it.',
    'Sobered, Yasuo returned to the school the next day, only to be surrounded by the remaining students, their swords drawn.Elder Souma was dead, and Yasuo found himself accused not only of dereliction, but of murder.He realized the true killer would go unpunished if he did not act quickly, so he fought his way free, though he knew this would all but confirm his apparent guilt.',
    'Now a fugitive in war - torn Ionia, Yasuo sought any clue that might lead him to the murderer.All the while, he was hunted by his former allies, continually forced to fight or die.This was a price he was willing to pay, until he was tracked down by the one he dreaded most—his own brother, Yone.',
    'Bound by honor, they circled each other.When their swords finally met, Yone was no match and, with a single flash of steel, Yasuo cut his brother down.',
    'He begged forgiveness, but Yone’s dying words were of the wind techniques responsible for Elder Souma’s death, and that his brother was the only one who could have known them.Then he fell silent, passing on before he could grant any absolution.',
    'Without master or brother, Yasuo roamed the mountains distraught, drinking away the pain of war and loss, a sword without a sheath.There in the snow, he met Taliyah, a young Shuriman stone mage who had fled the Noxian military.In her, Yasuo saw an unlikely student, and in himself, an even more unlikely teacher.He trained her in the ways of elemental magic, wind shaping stone, embracing at last the teachings of Elder Souma.',
    'Their world changed with rumors of a risen Shuriman god - emperor.Yasuo and Taliyah parted ways, though he gifted her the treasured maple seed, its lesson now learned.As she returned to her native desert sands, Yasuo set out for his own village, determined to put right his mistakes and find his old master’s true killer.',
    'Within the stone walls of the council hall, Elder Souma’s death was revealed to have been an accident, one brought about by the Noxian exile known as Riven—and one for which she felt deep remorse.Even so, Yasuo still could not absolve himself of the choice he had made to abandon his master or, worse yet, how that choice had ultimately led to Yone’s death.',
    'To this day, Yasuo continues to wander the land, his sense of guilt the only thing weighing down the free wind.',
    "Built on perpetual conflict, Noxus has never had a shortage of war orphans. Her father lost to an unnamed battle and her mother to the girl’s own stubborn birth, Riven was raised on a farm run by the empire on the rocky hillsides of Trevale.",
    "Physical strength and ferocious will kept the children alive and working on the hard scrap of land, but Riven hungered for more than simply bread on the table. She watched conscriptors from regional warbands visiting the farms, year after year, and in them, she saw a chance at the life she dreamed of. When she finally pledged the empire her strength, she knew Noxus would embrace her as the daughter she longed to be.",
    "Riven proved a natural soldier. Young as she was, her years of hard labor allowed her to quickly master the weight of a longsword taller than herself. Her new family was forged in the heat of battle, and Riven saw her bond to her brothers- and sisters-in-arms as unbreakable.",
    "So exceptional was her dedication to the empire, that Boram Darkwill himself recognized her with a runic blade of dark stone, enchanted by a pale sorceress within his court. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad—perfectly suited to Riven’s tastes. Not long after, the warhosts set sail for Ionia as part of the long-planned Noxian invasion.",
    "As this new war dragged on, it became clear that Ionia would not kneel. Riven’s unit was assigned to escort another warband making its way through the embattled province of Navori. The warband’s leader, Emystan, had employed a Zaunite alchymist, eager to test a new kind of weapon. Across countless campaigns, Riven would gladly have given her life for Noxus, but now she saw something awry in these other soldiers—something that made her deeply uncomfortable. The fragile amphorae they carried on their wagons had no purpose on any battlefield she could imagine…",
    "The two warbands met increasingly fierce resistance, as if even the land itself sought to defy them. During a heavy rain storm, with mud pouring down the hillsides, Riven and her warriors were stranded with their deadly cargo—and it was then that the Ionian fighters revealed themselves. Seeing the danger, Riven called to Emystan for support.",
    "The only answer she received was a flaming arrow, fired out from the ridgeline, and Riven understood this was no longer a war to expand the borders of Noxus. It was to be a complete annihilation of the enemy, no matter the cost.",
    "The wagon was hit straight on. Instinctively, Riven drew her sword, but it was too late to protect anyone but herself. Chemical fire burst from the ruptured containers, and screams filled the night—both Ionian and Noxian falling victim to an agonizing, gruesome death. Shielded from the scorching, poisonous mists by the magic of her blade, she bore unwilling witness to scenes of horror and betrayal that would haunt her forever.",
    "For Riven, memories of the hours that followed come only in fragments, and nightmares. She bound her wounds. She mourned the dead. But, most of all, she came to hate the sword that saved her life. The words carved into its surface mocked her, reminding her of all she had lost. She would find a way to break it, severing her last tie to Noxus, before the dawn. But when the blade was finally shattered, still she found no peace.",
    "Stripped of the faith and conviction that had bolstered her entire life, Riven chose to exile herself, wandering Ionia’s battle-scarred landscape. When she finally returned to the village where she had broken the sword, it was revealed that her self-destructive needs had cost the life of their most revered elder… but where Noxus would certainly have condemned Riven to death for such a crime, Ionia embraced her with forgiveness.",
    "Though the empire has long since withdrawn from the shores of the First Lands, Riven remains haunted. The balance of power has shifted across Valoran, and she can no longer be sure what she will become, when she is made whole once more."
